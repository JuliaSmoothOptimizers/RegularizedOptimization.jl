# A Proximal Quasi-Newton Trust-Region Method for Regularized Optimization
This package contains code to solve regularized optimization problems of the form

minâ‚“f(x) + h(x)

where f(x) is smooth and h(x) is nonsmooth; each can be nonconvex.

## Installation
To install the package, hit `]` from the Julia command line to enter the package manager and type
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/UW-AMO/TRNC
