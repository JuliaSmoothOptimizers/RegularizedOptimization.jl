Namely, the former computes the y vector for which the pair (s, y) is pushed into the approximation. By default, y := ∇fk⁻ - ∇fk. The latter allows the user to tell which values should be copied for the next iteration. By default, only the gradient is copied: ∇fk⁻ .= ∇fk. This might be useful when using R2N in a constrained optimization context, when the gradient of the Lagrangian function is pushed at each iteration rather than the gradient of the objective function.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#RegularizedOptimization.RegularizedExecutionStats-Union{Tuple{RegularizedProblems.AbstractRegularizedNLPModel{T, V}}, Tuple{V}, Tuple{T}} where {T, V}","page":"Reference","title":"RegularizedOptimization.RegularizedExecutionStats","text":"GenericExecutionStats(reg_nlp :: AbstractRegularizedNLPModel{T, V})\n\nConstruct a GenericExecutionStats object from an AbstractRegularizedNLPModel.
